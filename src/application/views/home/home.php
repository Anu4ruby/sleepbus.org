<p><img alt="" src="/images/sleepbus.png" /> &nbsp; is an Australian registered charity ending the need for people to sleep rough in Australia within 6 years. We convert buses into safe, temporary overnight accommodation to get people off the street and keep them safe and healthy until they can get back on their feet. Our motto is "sleep changes everything'; we believe that with a good nights sleep, the pathways out of homelessness will be a little easier to see.</p>

<h2>A Bold idea. Always use 100%</h2>

<p>100% of your donation is allocated to a sleepbus project; that&rsquo;s our 100% Model promise to you. When you donate or fundraise, every dollar goes to building and maintaining a sleepbus project. Private donors fund our Charity operating costs, so 100% of your money can go towards getting people off the street.</p>

<h2>We prove everything</h2>

<p>We prove exactly where your money goes. Once your donation is allocated to a project, you will receive photos of YOUR bus and its nightly service location, then you can go to see your bus personally if you wish and when you do, you&rsquo;ll see your name on it as one of its supporters.</p>

<p>When a person is without a home and forced to spend a night on the street, finding a safe place to sleep changes everything. It can help protect a persons mental and physical health and safety and we believe that with a safe sleep and a clear head, the pathways out of homelessness will be a little easier to see. Sleep changes everything.</p>
