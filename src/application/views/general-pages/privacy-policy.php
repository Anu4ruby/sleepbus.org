<h1>Privacy Policy for sleepbus</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: left;padding: 0px;">Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>

<p>sleepbus knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate you trusting that we will do so carefully and sensibly. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by sleepbus. The information below explains our policy regarding your privacy, both online and offline. By visiting <a href="/">www.sleepbus.org</a> or sharing personal information with sleepbus you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;padding: 0px;">What personally identifiable information is collected by sleepbus?</h2>

<p>When you visit our website or make a donation online or offline, you may provide us with personal information (such as name, address, email address, telephone numbers and/or credit/debit card information) that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis for various purposes. These purposes include registering to receive email newsletters or other materials, requesting further information from us about projects and services, donating to us, ordering merchandise, making requests, submitting a form on our website, or simply asking a question. We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way, whether it is online or offline. We ask for personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your message. This information is retained and used in accordance with existing laws, rules, regulations, and other policies. sleepbus does not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we may not be able to fulfill your request or complete your order, but you will still be free to browse the other sections of the websites owned and administered by sleepbus. This means that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;padding: 0px;">The way we use information</h2>

<p>When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for only that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to receive information, to make a donation, to purchase merchandise, or to apply for a job. Similarly, we use information you provide about yourself or someone else when placing a merchandise order only to ship the merchandise and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>

<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates on our new projects and services or on our merchandise. Information you submit on our website or over the phone will not be used for this purpose unless a registration form is filled out.</p>

<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p>sleepbus does not sell, rent, give-away or share its email addresses or other personal contact information with outside sources. sleepbus also does not send mailings on behalf of other organisations.</p>

<p>Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we use personally identifiable information, sleepbus will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or email consent from you. We will also post the changes to our use of personally identifiable information on our website at least 30 days prior to a change.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;padding: 0px;">Our commitment to data security</h2>

<p>Personally identifiable information is stored on our server and is not publicly accessible. Further, personally identifiable information is only accessed by sleepbus personnel on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Additionally, sensitive data such as credit card numbers are encrypted using SSL and other industry standard measures, to provide an additional level of security.</p>
